# Slip-and-Dilation-Tendencies
This file contains the slip and dilation tendencies of segments from 2741 faults (https://www.bgs.ac.uk/datasets/bgs-geology/) <br>
calculated using the stresses from Kingdon, A., Williams, J., Fellgett, M., Rettelbach, N., Heidbach, O., 2022. Stress Map of Great Britain and Ireland 2022.<br>
Please cite "Variations in the in-situ stress field affect slip and dilation tendencies of UK onshore faults"<br>
T. G. Blenkinsop (in prep)<br>

Column headings:

segment: segment number<br>
fault: fault number<br>
SH azi: Azimuth of maximum horizotal stress<br>
dip: segment dip<br>
Dip direction: segment dip direction<br>
ts1 etc.: trend of sigma 1, 2, 3<br>
ps1 etc: plunge of sigma 1, 2, 3<br>
phi: Bishop's stress ratio<br>
theta_deg: Angle of internal friction<br>
ST: Normalised Slip Tendency<br>
DT: Normalsied Dilation Tendency<br>
Import the csv file to a GIS as a text-delimited file, noting that the geographic information for the fault segmetns is in the final column as WKT text<br>
Labels are provded as a .gpkg file<br>
The Slip and Dilation tendencies are also avialable in gpkg format<br>

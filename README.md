# Slip-and-Dilation-Tendencies
This file contains the slip and dilation tendencies of segments from 2741 faults (https://www.bgs.ac.uk/datasets/bgs-geology/) 

calculated using the stresses from Kingdon, A., Williams, J., Fellgett, M., Rettelbach, N., Heidbach, O., 2022. Stress Map of Great Britain and Ireland 2022.
